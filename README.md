# Hand Gesture Controlled Presentation

This project is aimed at creating a presentation control system using hand gestures. By detecting and recognizing specific hand gestures, users can navigate through slides in a presentation without the need for traditional input devices such as a keyboard or mouse.

## Features
- **Gesture Recognition:** The system utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize predefined hand gestures.
- **Slide Navigation:** Users can control the forward and backward movement of slides using hand gestures.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system is designed to be intuitive and easy to use for presenters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (optional, depending on the chosen gesture recognition approach)
- Presentation software compatible with external control (e.g., PowerPoint)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

## Usage
1. Connect a camera to your computer.
2. Run the main script:
3. Follow the instructions to calibrate the system and start controlling the presentation with hand gestures.
